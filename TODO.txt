[*] Handle adding of new glyphs codepoints as they are used, dynamically.               [PARTIALLY DONE]
[*] Implement font searching based on language/charset, weight, pitch and spacing.      [DONE]
[*] Add OSX and Windows support.                                                        [NOT DONE]

Not sure if I will implement word wrapping. It is something which is more at home in an UI.
Glyphs are loaded into the atlas as they are discovered in the string to be rendered. However,
if a codepoint is *not* found in the font file, no new font files will be loaded to render the glyph.
But this could be implemented outside the font class.

[Quadtree: ]
[*] Change rendering to solely use OpenGL 3 core.                                       [NOT DONE]
